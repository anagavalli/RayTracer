# RayTracer

Simple recursive RayTracer made in C++, mainly for practice and review.

Currently only spheres, point lights, and directional lights are supported.

Only basic Blinn-Phong shading is implemented, nothing too fancy here.

Also scene must be set up manually in main.cpp, file reading was not really the point of this (and is also very annoying).
